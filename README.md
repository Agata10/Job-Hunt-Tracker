## About

Tha webisite is the task from Software Engineering Bootcamp.
<br>
The requirements were to create minimum 3 pages website and practice HTML and CSS.
<br>
The app has main page, user can either go to login or sign up.
<br>
On the login/sign up page user is able to pick menu from dropdown:

1. Home page
2. All jobs board
3. Wishlist board
4. Login page
5. Sign up page

<br>
I was using `FLEXBOX` for layout following `responsive design` practices.<br>
I added gif as background in table head and image as background of forms.<br>
What I learned: using `animation` to fade in objects and to slide in.<br>

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS

## Future app possibilities

There are possibilities to expand app for more features like:

1. Refactoring to React
2. Or using webpack to bundle files
3. Add functionality with JavaScript/TypeScript
4. Change dropdown menu to the navigation list
5. Add page where user can pick wishlist board/ previous applications board/ all applications board
